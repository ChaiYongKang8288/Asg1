                    <p>After being in the NBA for 20 years, Lebron James has amounted quite a sum of money from his salary from being one of the best player in the league.In his career, he has amounted a total of $529 million dollars from his rookie contract which was a 3 year, $12.9 million dollar contract which he signed in 2003 with the Cleveland Cavaliers.
                        He then had his contract resigned for a year for $5.8 million dollars in 2006 with the Cavaliers. He then had his rookie scale contract extension for $60.4 million dollar for four years with the Cavaliers. He then signed a 6 year contract for $110 million dollar with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat"> Miami Heat</a> in 2010 but in 2013 during the NBA off season , Lebron returned to the Cabvaliers to fufil his promise to Cleveland that he made when he got drafted to end the winning sports drought.
                        In 2014, he signed with the Cavaliers for 2 years 42.2 million. And again in 2016, he resigned a max contract with the Cavaliers for 100 million.

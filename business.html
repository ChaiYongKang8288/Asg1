He then had his rookie scale contract extension for $60.4 million dollar for four years with the Cavaliers. He then signed a 6 year contract for $110 million dollar with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat"> Miami Heat</a> in 2010 but in 2013 during the NBA off season , Lebron returned to the Cabvaliers to fufil his promise to Cleveland that he made when he got drafted to end the winning sports drought.
